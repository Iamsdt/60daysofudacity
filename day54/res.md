# Project: Restaurant App

## Objectives: 
Building a restaurant with food recommendation system

## Work flow

2. The workflow is  like you get in to the Restaurant and the waiter gives you  TAB for Ordering food!!! 

* If you scan the camera over any image in the Restaurant the app  will be able to classify the food!!!!

* The app will also be able to give you recommendation according to your taste. and will also be able to show you the best selling food item in that particular Restaurant!!!!

* Now coming to the Federated Learning part!!!
We'll be maintaining a Central Server!!! 
In this server we'll be storing our Recommendation Model, This model will be sent to wherever the data ;lives(in a particular restaurant) and sent back to the central server!!! 
In this way we'll be able to train the model for multiple Restaurants!!!

3. We're currently building this Recommendation System for a Company so we can only share snippets of code for now ,not the entire code!!!
